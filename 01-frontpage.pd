> Dear Swaroop, I am taking a class from an instructor that has no interest in teaching. We are using Learning Python, second edition, by O'Reilly. It is not a text for beginner without any programming knowledge, and an instructor that should be working in another field.  Thank you very much for your book, without it I would be clueless about Python and programming. Thanks a million, you are able to 'break the message down' to a level that beginners can understand and not everyone can.

> I love your book! It is the greatest Python tutorial ever, and a very useful reference. Brilliant, a true masterpiece! Keep up the good work!
>
> -- _Chris-André Sommerseth_

> I'm just e-mailing you to thank you for writing Byte of Python online.  I had been attempting Python for a few months prior to stumbling across your book, and although I made limited success with pyGame, I never completed a program.
>
> Thanks to your simplification of the categories, Python actually seems a reachable goal. It seems like I have finally learned the foundations and I can continue into my real goal, game development.

>
> Once again, thanks VERY much for placing such a structured and helpful guide to basic programming on the web.  It shoved me into and out of OOP with an understanding where two text books had failed.

> I would like to thank you for your book 'A byte of python' which i myself find the best way to learn python. I am a 15 year old i live in egypt my name is Ahmed. Python was my second programming language i learn visual basic 6 at school but didn't enjoy it, however i really enjoyed learning python. I made the addressbook program and i was sucessful. i will try to start make more programs and read python programs (if you could tell me source that would be helpful). I will also start on learning java and if you can tell me where to find a tutorial as good as yours for java that would help me a lot. Thanx.
